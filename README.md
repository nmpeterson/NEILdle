# NEILdle

Like [Worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr), but for Northeastern Illinois (NEIL). Rather than guessing countries, NEILdle is focused on the 284 municipalities that are wholly or partially within the seven counties of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will.

NEILdle is written in R using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com). Most code comes from [wch/shiny-wordle](https://www.github.com/wch/shiny-wordle)'s implementation of the immensely popular [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle), but significant modifications have been made so that the game functions more like the geography-based Worldle than the purely word-based Wordle.
